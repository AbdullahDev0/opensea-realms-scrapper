# Introduction
This code is for opensea data extraxtion for realms collection extraction. This project was for a client (https://www.freelancer.com/u/taha7emdaan), since he scammed me after I completed this work and shared the code with him, so I decided to outsource it. The work was part of his client which he was outsourcing, I only have his client's TeamViewer ID (1590470532) as I had to spend few hours on his PC too.
